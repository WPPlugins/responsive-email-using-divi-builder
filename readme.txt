Stop sending plain text emails to your website users! A professional looking email rendering nicely on various devices add tremendous value to your website. In digital marketing, emails have one of the highest 'Returns on Investment'.

Responsive email design is a process used to render on numerous email apps and clients running on devices with various operating system and form factors right from desktops and mobile devices. Also, there are many quirks like in-lining styles, non supported media queries, use of nested tables etc to consistently render email across devices.

Designing responsive email is hard, very hard.

The 'Responsive Email using Divi Builder' plugin provides an intuitive way to design emails using the Divi Page Builder. It adds a set of modules for email header, footer, paragraph, call to action button to the Divi library.

This plugin creates default responsive emails for WordPress **user registration** and **forgot password** emails instead of the default plain text emails. "Email Templates" in the left side bar menu in WordPress admin, contains all the **responsive email** templates.

*Note: This plugin has not been tested on a WordPress multisite.*
